Version 1.11   29.May.1999

* t1ascii and t1binary each accept both PFA and PFB fonts. If you pass an
  ASCII font (PFA) to t1ascii, it will output it mostly unchanged, and
  similarly for PFB fonts and t1binary. Both programs' `-l' options will
  still take effect, so you can use `t1ascii -l 80' to shorten the
  encrypted line lengths of a PFA font. t1ascii also does some newline
  translation (changes carriage returns to newlines).

* Bug fix in t1disasm: some fonts were not being disassembled correctly.
  Caught by Luc Devroye <luc@CS.McGill.CA>.


Version 1.10.1   12.Apr.1999

* t1asm: Fixed bug when `-l' option wasn't provided. Caught by Giuseppe
  Ghibò <ghibo@caesar.polito.it>.


Version 1.10   11.Apr.1999

* t1asm/t1disasm: Provide support for Type1C (Compact Font Format) font
  files. These fonts have unencrypted character strings, signalled by a
  negative lenIV value. Suggestion and patch thanks to Tom Kacvinsky
  <tjk@ams.org>.

* t1ascii/t1asm: Added `-l/--line-length' option to control maximum
  encrypted line length. Suggestion thanks to Giuseppe Ghibò
  <ghibo@caesar.polito.it>.


Version 1.9   14.Feb.1999

* t1asm/t1disasm: Be more robust on fonts that don't end in `mark
  currentfile closefile'. John Vromans <JVromans@squirrel.nl> provided a
  font that ended with `mark' on one line and `currentfile closefile' on
  another; t1asm and t1disasm did not recognize the encrypted section of
  the font had ended, and generated some garbage.


Version 1.8   2.Jan.1999

* Added some more Type 2 commands (flex, flex1, hflex, hflex1) from a
  revision of the Type 2 spec. (I wouldn't have known about this except for
  CurveSoft's revised t1utils package, available at
  http://www.curvesoft.com. These t1utils are more up-to-date than theirs,
  however.)

* t1asm: Fixed one Type 2 command's translation (cntrmask was incorrectly
  mapped to 18, not 20).


Version 1.7.2   11.Dec.1998

* Integrated patches from Jan-Jaap van der Heijden
  <J.J.vanderHeijden@student.utwente.nl> to support building t1utils under
  32-bit Windows.


Version 1.7.1   5.Dec.1998

* The t1utils package now uses automake.


Version 1.7   27.Nov.1998

* t1asm: Should now work with fonts that have no /Subrs sections. Previously,
  assembling such a font would silently fail; all the character definitions
  would be mistaken for procedures and t1asm wouldn't translate them. Problem
  noticed and fix suggested by Tom Kacvinsky <tjk@ams.org>.

* t1disasm: Removed spurious debugging output and improved warning message
  about unknown charstring commands.

* Changed fgetc/fputc into getc/putc.


Version 1.6   27.Sep.1998

* `--help' now prints to stdout, following the GNU Coding Standards.

* Makefiles: Added `make uninstall' target, enabled `./configure's
  program name transformations, made VPATH builds possible.


Version 1.5.2   6.Aug.1998

* t1asm/t1disasm: Changed unknown charstring commands at the request of
  Werner Lemberg and LEE Chun-Yu. An unknown escape in the charstring, like
  12 X, is translated to "escape_X" rather than "UNKNOWN_12_X".


Version 1.5.1   31.May.1998

* t1unmac did not actually understand the -r and -b options. Fixed.

* t1unmac: Added better diagnostics to help you diagnose seeking problems.


Version 1.5   5.Mar.1998

* Initial release with Eddie Kohler as maintainer.

* All: Updated to the GNU program behavior standards (long options, --help,
  --version). Banners removed. Added more error messages.

* t1binary: Removed fixed limit on line length.

* t1binary: Supports Macintosh files, whose lines end in `\r'.

* t1binary: Supports an odd number of hex digits in a line.

* t1asm/t1disasm: Added support for Type 2 commands like `blend' and `add',
  which also appear in some multiple master fonts like Adobe Jenson.

* t1asm/t1disasm: Added support for unknown charstring commands. t1disasm
  translates an unknown command #X to "UNKNOWN_X", and t1asm does the reverse.

* t1asm/t1unmac: Changed default output to PFB.

* t1unmac: Used to be called `unpost'. `t1unmac' is a much better name.
